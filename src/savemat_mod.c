/*
 * savemat - C language routine to save a matrix in a MAT-file.
 *
 * We recommend that you use this routine, and its companion loadmat.c,
 * for all writing and reading of MAT-files.  These routines implement
 * "access methods" for MAT-files.  By using these routines, instead
 * of writing your own code to directly access the MAT-file format,
 * you will be unaffected by any changes that may be made to the MAT-file
 * structure at a future date.
 *
 * Here is an example that uses 'savemat' to save two matrices to disk,
 * the second of which is complex:
 *
 *	FILE *fp;
 *	double xyz[1000], ar[1000], ai[1000];
 *	fp = fopen("foo.mat","wb");
 *	savemat(fp, 2000, "xyz", 2, 3, 0, xyz, (double *)0);
 *	savemat(fp, 2000, "a", 5, 5, 1, ar, ai);
 *      fclose(fp);
 *
 * Author J.N. Little 11-3-86
 * Revised 7-23-91 to support ANSI-C

/* The fields must be 4-byte integers.  The definition was changed
 * here, these were "long" as in the Matlab documentation.  On 64-bit
 * systems, "long" is 8-bytes.  The Matlab example was probably
 * produced back in the days when ints were 16 bits.
